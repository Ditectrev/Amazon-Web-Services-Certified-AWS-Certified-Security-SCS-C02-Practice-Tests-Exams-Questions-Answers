### A company that uses AWS Organizations is using AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to administer access to AWS accounts. A security engineer is creating a custom permission set in IAM Identity Center. The company will use the permission set across multiple accounts. An AWS managed policy and a customer managed policy are attached to the permission set. The security engineer has full administrative permissions and is operating in the management account. When the security engineer attempts to assign the permission set to an IAM Identity Center user who has access to multiple accounts, the assignment fails. What should the security engineer do to resolve this failure?

- [x] Create the customer managed policy in every account where the permission set is assigned. Give the customer managed policy the same name and same permissions in each account.
- [ ] Remove either the AWS managed policy or the customer managed policy from the permission set. Create a second permission set that includes the removed policy. Apply the permission sets separately to the user.
- [ ] Evaluate the logic of the AWS managed policy and the customer managed policy. Resolve any policy conflicts in the permission set before deployment.

- [ ] In CloudTrail, turn on Insights events on the trail. Configure an alarm on the insight with eventName matching ConsoleLogin and errorMessage matching "Failed authentication''. Configure a threshold of 3 and a period of 5 minutes.
- [x] Configure CloudTrail to send events to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Create a metric filter for the relevant log group. Create a filter pattern with eventName matching ConsoleLogin and errorMessage matching "Failed authentication". Create a CloudWatch alarm with a threshold of 3 and a period of 5 minutes.
- [ ] Create an Amazon Athena table from the CloudTrail events. Run a query for eventName matching ConsoleLogin and for errorMessage matching "Failed authentication". Create a notification action from the query to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the count equals 3 within a period of 5 minutes.
- [ ] In AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer, create a new analyzer. Configure the analyzer to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when a failed sign-in event occurs 3 times for any IAM user within a period of 5 minutes.

### A company's security engineer receives an abuse notification from AWS. The notification indicates that someone is hosting malware from the company's AWS account. After investigation, the security engineer finds a new Amazon S3 bucket that an IAM user created without authorization. Which combination of steps should the security engineer take to MINIMIZE the consequences of this compromise? (Choose three.)

- [ ] Encrypt all AWS CloudTrail logs.
- [ ] Turn on Amazon GuardDuty.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Configure the permissions on the individual files in the S3 bucket so that only the CloudFront distribution has access to them.
- [x] Create an origin access control (OAC). Associate the OAC with the CloudFront distribution. Configure the S3 bucket permissions so that only the OAC can access the files in the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Create an S3 role in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Allow only the CloudFront distribution to assume the role to access the files in the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Create an S3 bucket policy that uses only the CloudFront distribution ID as the principal and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) as the target.

### A company does not allow the permanent installation of SSH keys onto an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance. However, three employees who have IAM user accounts require access to the EC2 instance. The employees must use an SSH session to perform critical duties. How can a security engineer provide the appropriate access to the EC2 instance to meet these requirements?

- [ ] Use AWS Systems Manager Inventory to select the EC2 instance and connect. Provide the IAM user accounts with the permissions to use Systems Manager Inventory.
- [ ] Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to open an SSH connection to the EC2 instance. Provide the IAM user accounts with the permissions to use Run Command.

### A company wants to prevent SSH access through the use of SSH key pairs for any Amazon Linux 2 Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. However, a system administrator occasionally will need to access these EC2 instances through SSH in an emergency. For auditing purposes, the company needs to record any commands that a user runs in an EC2 instance. What should a security engineer do to configure access to these EC2 instances to meet these requirements?

- [ ] Use the EC2 serial console. Configure the EC2 serial console to save all commands that are entered to an Amazon S3 bucket. Provide the EC2 instances with an IAM role that allows the EC2 serial console to access Amazon S3. Configure an IAM account for the system administrator. Provide an IAM policy that allows the IAM account to use the EC2 serial console.
- [ ] Use EC2 Instance Connect. Configure EC2 Instance Connect to save all commands that are entered to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Provide the EC2 instances with an IAM role that allows the EC2 Instances to access CloudWatch Logs. Configure an IAM account for the system administrator. Provide an IAM policy that allows the IAM account to use EC2 Instance Connect.
- [ ] Use an EC2 key pair with an EC2 instance that needs SSH access. Access the EC2 instance with this key pair by using SSH. Configure the EC2 instance to save all commands that are entered to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Provide the EC2 instance with an IAM role that allows the EC2 instance to access Amazon S3 and CloudWatch Logs.
- [x] Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Configure Session Manager to save all commands that are entered in a session to an Amazon S3 bucket. Provide the EC2 instances with an IAM role that allows Systems Manager to manage the EC2 instances. Configure an IAM account for the system administrator. Provide an IAM policy that allows the IAM account to use Session Manager.

### A company is using AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts. The company has an application that allows users to assume the AppUser IAM role to download files from an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted with an AWS KMS CMK. However, when users try to access the files in the S3 bucket, they get an access denied error. What should a security engineer do to troubleshoot this error? (Choose three.)

- [x] Ensure the KMS policy allows the AppUser role to have permission to decrypt for the CMK.
- [x] Ensure the S3 bucket policy allows the AppUser role to have permission to get objects for the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Ensure the CMK was created before the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Ensure the S3 block public access feature is enabled for the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Ensure that automatic key rotation is disabled for the CMK.

### A company uses infrastructure as code (IaC) to create AWS infrastructure. The company writes the code as AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy the infrastructure. The company has an existing CI/CD pipeline that the company can use to deploy these templates. After a recent security audit, the company decides to adopt a policy-as-code approach to improve the company's security posture on AWS. The company must prevent the deployment of any infrastructure that would violate a security policy, such as an unencrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Turn on AWS Trusted Advisor. Configure security notifications as webhooks in the preferences section of the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Turn on AWS Config. Use the prebuilt rules or customized rules. Subscribe tile CI/CD pipeline to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that receives notifications from AWS Config.
- [x] Create rule sets in AWS CloudFormation Guard. Run validation checks for CloudFormation templates as a phase of the CI/CD process.
- [ ] Create rule sets as SCPs. Integrate the SCPs as a part of validation control in a phase of the CI/CD process.

### A Security Engineer is working with the development team to design a supply chain application that stores sensitive inventory data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The application will use an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to encrypt the data on Amazon S3. The inventory data on Amazon S3 will be shared of vendors. All vendors will use AWS principals from their own AWS accounts to access the data on Amazon S3. The vendor list may change weekly, and the solution must support cross-account access. What is the MOST efficient way to manage access control for the KMS CMK7?

- [x] Use KMS grants to manage key access. Programmatically create and revoke grants to manage vendor access.
- [ ] Use an IAM role to manage key access. Programmatically update the IAM role policies to manage vendor access.
