### A company uses AWS Organizations to manage a small number of AWS accounts. However, the company plans to add 1 000 more accounts soon. The company allows only a centralized security team to create IAM roles for all AWS accounts and teams. Application teams submit requests for IAM roles to the security team. The security team has a backlog of IAM role requests and cannot review and provision the IAM roles quickly. The security team must create a process that will allow application teams to provision their own IAM roles. The process must also limit the scope of IAM roles and prevent privilege escalation. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

### A company has a legacy application that runs on a single Amazon EC2 instance. A security audit shows that the application has been using an IAM access key within its code to access an Amazon S3 bucket that is named DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1 in the same AWS account. This access key pair has the `s3:GetObject` permission to all objects in only this S3 bucket.

### A company recently had a security audit in which the auditors identified multiple potential threats. These potential threats can cause usage pattern changes such as DNS access peak, abnormal instance traffic, abnormal network interface traffic, and unusual Amazon S3 API calls. The threats can come from different sources and can occur at any time. The company needs to implement a solution to continuously monitor its system and identify all these incoming threats in near-real time. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, and DNS logs. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to manage these logs from a centralized account.
- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, and DNS logs. Use Amazon Macie to monitor these logs from a centralized account.

- [ ] Enable Amazon Inspector from a centralized account. Use Amazon Inspector to manage AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, and DNS logs.

### A company that uses AWS Organizations is using AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to administer access to AWS accounts. A security engineer is creating a custom permission set in IAM Identity Center. The company will use the permission set across multiple accounts. An AWS managed policy and a customer managed policy are attached to the permission set. The security engineer has full administrative permissions and is operating in the management account. When the security engineer attempts to assign the permission set to an IAM Identity Center user who has access to multiple accounts, the assignment fails. What should the security engineer do to resolve this failure?

- [x] Create the customer managed policy in every account where the permission set is assigned. Give the customer managed policy the same name and same permissions in each account.
- [ ] Remove either the AWS managed policy or the customer managed policy from the permission set. Create a second permission set that includes the removed policy. Apply the permission sets separately to the user.
- [ ] Evaluate the logic of the AWS managed policy and the customer managed policy. Resolve any policy conflicts in the permission set before deployment.
- [ ] Do not add the new permission set to the user. Instead, edit the user's existing permission set to include the AWS managed policy and the customer managed policy.

### A company has recently recovered from a security incident that required the restoration of Amazon EC2 instances from snapshots. The company uses an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. The company performs a gap analysis of its disaster recovery procedures and backup strategies. A security engineer needs to implement a solution so that the company can recover the EC2 instances if the AWS account is compromised and the EBS snapshots are deleted.

- [ ] Use AWS Backup to copy EBS snapshots to Amazon S3. Use S3 Object Lock to prevent deletion of the snapshots.

### A company's security engineer is designing an isolation procedure for Amazon EC2 instances as part of an incident response plan. The security engineer needs to isolate a target instance to block any traffic to and from the target instance, except for traffic from the company's forensics team. Each of the company's EC2 instances has its own dedicated security group. The EC2 instances are deployed in subnets of a VPC. A subnet can contain multiple instances. The security engineer is testing the procedure for EC2 isolation and opens an SSH session to the target instance. The procedure starts to simulate access to the target instance by an attacker. The security engineer removes the existing security group rules and adds security group rules to give the forensics team access to the target instance on port 22. After these changes, the security engineer notices that the SSH connection is still active and usable. When the security engineer runs a ping command to the public IP address of the target instance, the ping command is blocked. What should the security engineer do to isolate the target instance?

- [ ] Add an inbound rule to the security group to allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 for all ports. Add an outbound rule to the security group to allow traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 for all ports. Then immediately delete these rules.
- [x] Remove the port 22 security group rule. Attach an instance role policy that allows AWS Systems Manager Session Manager connections so that the forensics team can access the target instance.
- [ ] Create a network ACL that is associated with the target instance's subnet. Add a rule at the top of the inbound rule set to deny all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. Add a rule at the top of the outbound rule set to deny all traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.
- [ ] Create an AWS Systems Manager document that adds a host-level firewall rule to block all inbound traffic and outbound traffic. Run the document on the target instance.

### A company is using AWS to run a long-running analysis process on data that is stored in Amazon S3 buckets. The process runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. The EC2 instances are deployed in a private subnet of a VPC that does not have internet access. The EC2 instances and the S3 buckets are in the same AWS account. The EC2 instances access the S3 buckets through an S3 gateway endpoint that has the default access policy. Each EC2 instance is associated with an instance profile role that has a policy that explicitly allows the `s3:GetObject` action and the `s3:PutObject` action for only the required S3 buckets. The company learns that one or more of the EC2 instances are compromised and are exfiltrating data to an S3 bucket that is outside the company's organization in AWS Organizations. A security engineer must implement a solution to stop this exfiltration of data and to keep the EC2 processing job functional. Which solution will meet these requirements?
